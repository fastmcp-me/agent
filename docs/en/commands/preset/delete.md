## Use Cases

### Configuration Cleanup

```bash
# Review unused presets
npx -y @1mcp/agent preset list

# Delete presets that show "never" in Last Used column
npx -y @1mcp/agent preset delete unused-preset
npx -y @1mcp/agent preset delete old-experiment
```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Clean up temporary presets after testing
npx -y @1mcp/agent preset delete test-temp
npx -y @1mcp/agent preset delete debug-session
npx -y @1mcp/agent preset delete experiment-2024
```

### Team Environment Management

```bash
# Remove deprecated team presets
npx -y @1mcp/agent preset delete legacy-prod
npx -y @1mcp/agent preset delete old-team-config
```

## Safety Considerations

### Important Presets

Before deleting presets that are actively used:

1. **Check usage**: Review "Last Used" date in `preset list`
2. **Verify impact**: Ensure no team members depend on the preset
3. **Document changes**: Inform team about preset removal
4. **Consider renaming**: Instead of deletion, consider renaming for clarity

### Backup Strategy

```bash
# Export preset configuration before deletion (manual backup)
npx -y @1mcp/agent preset show important-preset > backup-important-preset.txt

# Then delete if needed
npx -y @1mcp/agent preset delete important-preset
```

## Error Handling

### Preset Not Found

```bash
npx -y @1mcp/agent preset delete nonexistent
# Error: Preset 'nonexistent' not found
```

### Permission Issues

If there are file system permission issues:

```bash
npx -y @1mcp/agent preset delete locked-preset
# Error: Unable to delete preset: Permission denied
```

### Configuration File Issues

If the preset configuration file is corrupted:

```bash
npx -y @1mcp/agent preset delete corrupted-preset
# Error: Unable to read preset configuration file
```

## Workflow Integration

### Regular Maintenance

```bash
# 1. Review all presets
npx -y @1mcp/agent preset list

# 2. Identify unused presets (Last Used: never, old dates)
# 3. Verify with team that presets are truly unused
# 4. Delete unused presets
npx -y @1mcp/agent preset delete unused-1
npx -y @1mcp/agent preset delete unused-2

# 5. Verify cleanup
npx -y @1mcp/agent preset list
```

### After Project Changes

```bash
# When project requirements change, remove obsolete presets
npx -y @1mcp/agent preset delete old-architecture
npx -y @1mcp/agent preset delete deprecated-stack
```

## Best Practices

### Before Deletion

1. **Verify preset usage**: Check if any team members are using the preset
2. **Document dependencies**: Ensure no automation scripts reference the preset
3. **Check client configurations**: Verify no MCP clients use the preset URL
4. **Consider archiving**: For important historical presets, export before deletion

### Bulk Deletion

For multiple presets, delete one at a time to maintain control:

```bash
# Avoid bulk deletion scripts - delete individually for safety
npx -y @1mcp/agent preset delete preset1
npx -y @1mcp/agent preset delete preset2
```

### Team Coordination

- **Communicate changes**: Inform team members before deleting shared presets
- **Update documentation**: Remove references to deleted presets in team docs
- **Provide alternatives**: Suggest replacement presets if available

## Recovery

### No Built-in Recovery

Once a preset is deleted, it cannot be recovered through the CLI. However:

1. **Manual Recreation**: Use `preset create` or `1mcp preset` to recreate
2. **Backup Files**: If you exported preset details beforehand
3. **Version Control**: If your configuration is version controlled
4. **Team Knowledge**: Other team members may have the same preset

### Prevention

```bash
# Export preset details before deletion for potential recovery
npx -y @1mcp/agent preset show critical-preset > critical-preset-backup.json
npx -y @1mcp/agent preset delete critical-preset
```
